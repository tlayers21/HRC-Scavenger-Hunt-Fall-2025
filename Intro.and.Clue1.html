        <h1>Welcome to the HRC Scavenger Hunt!</h1>
        <p class="clue">If you complete this, you will receive an email which you can show to an SL, which will allow you to get one free stamp (a stamp in any square) for the HRC bingo!</p>
        <p class="clue">As you complete this scavenger hunt, you will find hidden QR codes throughout the HRC that will guide you to the end.</p>
        <p class="clue">Good luck! If you have any questions or need a hint, please email tlayers21@vt.edu (Tommy Ayers).</p>
        <p class="clue">To start, you should look where west meets east, particularly in a spot where objects are usually hidden.</p>
